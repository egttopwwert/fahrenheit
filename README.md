## Hello! I'm Fahrenheit!

I'm a smart assistant! I give my users relevant weather forecasts, advice what to wear for today, and remind to take umbrella :)

To start me you need to do the following steps:

1) Download this repositiry;
2) Get bot's token from @BotFather;
3) Create database.json file in bot's local folder;
4) Get API key from https://openweathermap.org/;
5) Set nessessary information in config.py;
6) Enjoy it!

Technical requirements:

1) Windows 7, 8.1 or 10;
2) Python 3.7+.

I were seperated on different components and commented all the code as maximum extent possible. So you won't get any trouble adding new features.

If you want to contribute your ideas to this project, please contact my developer.

Have a nice day :)
